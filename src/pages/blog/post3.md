## Have I lost my touch?

I've been feeling burnt out lately, making 3 whole blog posts takes a lot out of a person.
It's hard to say whether or not there will be more of these, but I will do my absolute
best to continue to put out quality blog posts. I wouldn't want the quality of my site
to drop.
